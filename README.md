# Gozelle

**Gozelle** is a lightning-fast, minimal directory-jumping tool written in Go â€” inspired by [`zoxide`](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide). Jump to frequently used directories with just a keyword, powered by **frecency scoring**, **fuzzy matching**, and **shell integration**.

## Features

- **Frecency Scoring** â€” jump history is ranked by frequency and recency  
- **Fuzzy Matching** â€” jump with just a keyword or part of a directory name  
- **Smart Ranking** â€” most relevant paths surface first  
- **Manual Add** â€” add directories to the index yourself  
- **Query Mode** â€” list matching directories without jumping  
- **Compact Storage** â€” gob-encoded data stored locally  
- **Shell Integration** â€” Bash command-line hooks for seamless tracking

## Installation

### 1. Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gozelle
cd gozelle
go build -o gozelle .
```

### 2. Move Binary to PATH

```bash
sudo mv gozelle /usr/local/bin/
```

### 3. Add to Bash Startup File

```bash
echo 'eval "$(gozelle init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

### Jump to a Directory

```bash
gz proj       # jumps to the best match (e.g., ~/projects)
```

### Show Matching Directories (without jumping)

```bash
gozelle query proj
```

### Add a Directory Manually

```bash
gozelle add /some/path/to/add
```

## How It Works

- Enables shell hooks for automatic logging via `init bash`
- Tracks every visited directory using the shell hook
- Stores them in a gob-encoded file under your user data directory (Default is ~.local/share/Gozelle for Linux users)
- Finds all matches for keywords entered i.e. gz keywords
- Ranks them using a **frecency** score (frequency + recency)

## Learnings & Concepts

This project is a hands-on learning opportunity for:

- **Concurrency** â€” handling simultaneous updates and queries efficiently  
- **Worker Pools** â€” to process background updates to scoring  
- **Mutexes** â€” for safe access to shared resources (like the gob database)  
- **Command Line Hooks** â€” shell integration and behavior injection
- **Gob Encoding** â€” simple and efficient binary data serialization in Go
